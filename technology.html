        <p class="tech-summary">It all starts with data. Lots of data... By utilizing first party, consumer provided, data, 3rd party data providers, and industry niche data partners....</p>
        <div class="tech-detail" id="bigdata-detail">
          <p>...we analyze over 500 property specific data points on every home in the United States, and over 200 consumer specific data points. Through this, we have compiled a vast data set that allows us to take the guess work out of predictive modeling. Our results are so accurate it even freaks us out sometimes.....more on that later.</p>

          <p>.....In short, we utilize predictive modeling to understand the likelihood of a real estate transaction, but most importantly, what type of real estate transaction is most likely to occur, (off market transaction vs. traditional MLS listing).</p>
          <p>Data Analysis/Predictive Modeling is simply identifying, and understanding patterns. By looking at past real estate transactions, and all of the variables that were present at that time, we can understand the importance (weighted scale) of certain variables, and their impact towards the outcome. This takes a lot of data, and a lot of time....the end result? A technology solution that doesn't 'guess' outcomes, in fact, what you are left with, is a technology solution that remains completely impartial to any one data point; that demands multiple data points be present and viable, before arriving at a conclusion.</p>
          <p><strong>'Prove Me Wrong'</strong> - One of the single, most powerful, components to the technology, is the constant seeking to prove itself wrong. How does it do that? It is constantly looking back to previous conclusions it has made, and looks for 'real life' updates to that property/home owner. For instance, if the system predicts the likelihood of a property changing possession as very low, but then sees that property involved in a transaction 30 days later, it will 'learn' from this inaccurate prediction, and most importantly, carry those new findings to all future conclusions....In essence, it is always learning, always improving, and always seeking to 'prove itself wrong'.</p>
